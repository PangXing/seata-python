## What is seata-python?

Seata is a very mature distributed transaction framework, and is the de facto standard platform for distributed transaction technology in the Java field. Seata-python is the implementation version of python language in Seata multilingual ecosystem, which realizes the interoperability between Java and python, so that python developers can also use seata-python to realize distributed transactions. Please visit the [official website of Seata](https://seata.io/en-us) to view the quick start and documentation.

The principle of seata-python is consistent with that of Seata-java, which is composed of TM, RM and TC. The functions of TC reuse Java, and the functions of TM and RM will be aligned with Seata-java later. The overall process is as follows:

## How to runï¼Ÿ

1. First download [**seata java**](https://github.com/seata/seata/tree/v1.5.2) and  Start the TC service. For the specific process, refer to  [**seata deployment guide**](https://seata.io/zh-cn/docs/ops/deploy-guide-beginner.ht ) Documentation
2. Just execute the main function under samples/ in the root directory
